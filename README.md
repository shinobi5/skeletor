Front-end boilerplate with a focus on the web platform. 

I've already used this on a few projects but it's still a work in progress and some features aren't fully fleshed out yet.

It represents how I like to work on personal projects. I want something with flexibility to address the needs of the project (Node? Deno? Static? SPA? PWA?) while also keeping frameworks and tools to a minimum (only what's required for the project).

Documentation for setup with either Node or Deno:

- [Setup with node](docs/NODE.md)
- [Setup with deno](docs/DENO.md)
